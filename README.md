Complete files can not be uploaded  but use the app.py to help build on this idea. the goal is to have a person download the file they would like to remake and or pattern they was to use and in the next section posting the instrument you want to be used when the pattern is remade.

issues i faced when writing was the sound being cut off being that this is simple i do not expect this code to be the best but if anyone wants to add on to this project feel free and let me know your changeses
